## My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud

**DevOps** is a way of working where development and operations teams collaborate closely to build, deploy, and maintain software efficiently.  
It focuses on automation, reliability, and faster delivery so systems are stable and issues are reduced before reaching users.

**Cloud Engineering** is about using cloud platforms to run servers and services over the internet instead of managing physical hardware.  
It allows teams to deploy systems quickly, scale based on demand, and pay only for what they use.

Together, DevOps and Cloud help teams build reliable systems faster and manage them with less manual effort.

## Where I Want to Reach (90-Day Goals)

1. Deploy a real-world application on Kubernetes with basic auto-scaling and monitoring  
2. Build a simple but complete CI/CD pipeline to automate build, test, and deployment  
3. Manage cloud infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code tools like Terraform

## Core DevOps Skills I Want to Build

1. Linux & system troubleshooting for production environments  
2. CI/CD pipelines for automated and reliable deployments  
3. Kubernetes basics including deployment, scaling, and troubleshooting

## Weekly Time Commitment

- Weekdays (Mon–Fri): 2–2.5 hours per day  
- Weekends (Sat–Sun): 4–6 hours per day  
- Total weekly time: ~18–24 hours

## How I Will Stay Consistent

- Spend at least some time every day, even if it’s just 30 minutes  
- Focus on hands-on practice instead of only watching videos  
- Maintain simple daily notes of what I learned and what didn’t work  
- Review progress weekly and adjust the plan if needed

**Duration:** 90 Days  
**Tracking:** GitHub repo or personal notes  

*This plan is my execution blueprint for the next 90 days.  
Consistency and honest effort matter more than perfection.*
